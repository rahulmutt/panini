# Contributor & agent guide

## Environment
- Toolchain is pinned via `mise` (`mise install`) to rust 1.97.1. Do not install
  Rust globally.
- Tasks: `mise run build | test | lint | fmt | fmt-check | mutants | audit`.
- Optional dev/audit tooling is pinned in `mise.dev.toml`. Install it on demand:
  `MISE_ENV=dev mise install`. This provides:
  - `cargo-mutants` (mutation testing) — `mise run mutants` runs
    `cargo mutants --package panini-prakriya`.
  - `cargo-deny` + `cargo-audit` (supply-chain checks) — `mise run audit` runs
    `cargo audit && cargo deny check` and is expected to pass, including
    `cargo deny check advisories`.
  - `cargo-fuzz` (fuzzing of `panini-lipi`, target at `crates/panini-lipi/fuzz`)
    — pinned here, but real fuzzing still needs a **nightly** Rust toolchain,
    which is not provisioned in this environment; install nightly yourself.

## Rules of the codebase
- SLP1 is the only internal representation; transliterate only in `panini-lipi`.
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in every non-fuzz crate (the `panini-lipi` fuzz
  target under `crates/panini-lipi/fuzz` legitimately omits it, since it uses
  `#![no_main]` plus the libfuzzer harness macro).
- Grammar changes are gated by the golden paradigm test
  (`crates/panini/tests/paradigm.rs`). Surface forms there are the source of
  truth; sūtra ids/names in traces must match the cited reference
  (ashtadhyayi.com).
- The `panini-cli` binary has a single subcommand, `check` (flags `--trace`,
  `--json`, `--out`, `--in`). There is no `derive` subcommand in v1. `--in auto`
  (the default) auto-detects the input transliteration scheme; passing an
  explicit `--in` scheme (`slp1`/`iast`/`hk`/`deva`) makes that scheme
  authoritative, overriding auto-detection.
